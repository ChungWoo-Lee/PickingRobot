##Project intro
---

the goal of the project is to build a device that collects shuttle cocks that are scattered on the court. such a device will be very helpful especially during lesson time. Ideally, we want the device to avoid any obstacle it encounters during its manuever and collect shuttlecock.
this will be acheieved through the implementation of Lidar sensor. Lidar will let the device recognize its surroundings and mark the obstacles.
The device will use a mutiple brush to suck up the shuttlecock on it. the brushes are attached to a conveyer belt.
it will be advantageous to make a design that allows the device to work not only when playing badminton, but also when playing other sports, such as tennis. This will be acheived by detachable head(conveyer belt)

##Some errors encountered during project
*lack of knowledge about conveyer belt.
*difficult to collect shuttlecocks lying with different orientation due to the complex shape they have.
*this error can be minimized by keeping the guide as close to th ground as possible. triming the brushes also helped the jammed shuttlecock to escape quickly.
*limit due to the material used: the material used was easy to fabricate, but difficult to have precision. horizontal leveling and vertical leveling cannot be easily acheived as
it is handcrafted. Witout any usage of professional cutting tools, the surface of the final device had rough surfaces.
*by using a perpendicular objects, we tried to build the device as precise as we can. hold the material with masking tape prior to glueing them turned out to be a very effective method.
